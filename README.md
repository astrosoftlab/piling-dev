# Matter-Bricks â€“ React + MatterJS 3D Physics Simulation

## Project Description
Matter-Bricks is a React project that utilizes Matter.js, a popular 2D rigid body physics engine for the web. This project is aimed at creating a 3D simulation of falling bricks and more. It serves as an excellent demonstration and practical application of physics in web development, game design, and how to incorporate physics and animation into a React-based application.

## Features
- Simulation of falling bricks in a 3D environment
- Realistic physics applied to the bricks such as gravity, friction, and inertia
- Ability to interact with the simulation by adding more bricks, removing bricks, altering the gravity
- A re-playable simulation

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your system
- Npm (Node Package Manager) which usually comes with Node.js

### Installation

1. Clone this repository by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<username>/matter-bricks.git
```

2. Navigate into the cloned project's directory:

```bash
cd matter-bricks
```

3. Install the project dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

4.  Start the React development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The project should be up and running on your local machine. Open a web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to start interacting with the application.

## Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/) - A 2D robust physics engine
